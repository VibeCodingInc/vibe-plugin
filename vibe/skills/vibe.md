# Vibe Skill

When triggered, call `vibe_start` to begin a vibe session.

## What is /vibe?

/vibe is a terminal-native social layer for Claude Code users. It lets developers:
- See who's online and what they're building
- Send DMs to other developers
- Share work context and get help
- Build connections in the AI coding community

## Common Triggers

- "vibe" or "let's vibe" → Start a session
- "who's online" or "who's around" → Check presence
- "vibe inbox" or "check messages" → See unread DMs
- "dm @handle" or "message @handle" → Send a message
- "vibe bye" → End session gracefully
